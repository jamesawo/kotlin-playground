# Kotlin Basics

This subdirectory is dedicated to mastering the fundamental concepts of Kotlin. Here, you'll find resources and examples to help you get started with the basics of Kotlin programming.

## Topics Covered:

-   **Function**: [0_Function.kt](0_Function.kt)

    -   fun keyword is used to declare a function
    -   the main() function is where your program starts from
    -   the body of a function is written within curly braces {}
    -   println() and print() functions print their arguments to standard output

-   **Variables** : [1_Variables.kt](1_Variables.kt)
    All programs need to be able to store data, and variables help you to do just that. In Kotlin, you can declare:

    -   read-only variables with val => value
    -   mutable variables with var => variable

-   **String templates** : [2_StringTemplate.kt](2_StringTemplate.kt)
    It's useful to know how to print the contents of variables to standard output. You can do this with string templates. You can use template expressions to access data stored in variables and other objects, and convert them into strings. A string value is a sequence of characters in double quotes ". Template expressions always start with a dollar sign $.

To evaluate a piece of code in a template expression, place the code within curly braces {} after the dollar sign $
