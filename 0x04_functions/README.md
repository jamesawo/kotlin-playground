# Functions

In Kotlin:

-   function parameters are written within parentheses `()`.

-   each parameter must have a type, and multiple parameters must be separated by commas ,.

-   the return type is written after the function's parentheses `()`, separated by a colon :.

-   the body of a function is written within curly braces `{}`.

-   the return keyword is used to exit or return something from a function.

In the following example:

-   x and y are function parameters.

-   x and y have type Int.

-   the function's return type is Int.

-   the function returns a sum of x and y when called.
